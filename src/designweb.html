        <h2 class="title title--high">Over time</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">Discover some of the progressively more complex projects realised by our students</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">As the school year progresses, various projects are completed and evaluated in order to put the skills acquired into practice.</p>
        <p class="txt">In fact, through the various courses in theory and practice of design, interface, typography, user experience and learning several programming languages. The student will be asked to produce several large projects based on various subjects of their choice or of their choice and to suit demand.</p>

        <h2 class="title title--high">1st WebSite</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">A must-have for every programming beginner !</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">Cliché or rather tradition, Hello World is the first steps of an apprentice developer.</p>
        <p class="txt">The first website to be created was a simple request: a home page, an inspiration page, a ui-kit and a presentation.</p>
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"I chose a fairly minimalist, dark design, inspired by Twitter, with shades of grey, white text and pictograms and rounded borders. Hello World was a first step, nice and simple to make."</p>

        <h3 class="title title--med">How to summarise, share and organise a personal experience.</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">The BeyondTellerand conference in Düsseldorf, which takes place every year and focuses on technology, development, design and inspiration.</p>
        <p class="txt">The objective of this project is to present the event, as well as one of the speakers, to summarise and present the essence of the subject covered, and to present it in a pertinent way.</p>
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"For this project there were several subjects to choose from, Stephen Hay's conference being the one that inspired me the most. I was inspired by Sakura for the colour palette, a contrast between a cursive typeface to highlight the relevance of Stephen's words and a sans serif for the explanatory part."</p>

        <h2 class="title title--high">Rethinking what already exists.</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">Reconsidering the present, imagining the future.</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">The goal of the RuX project is to learn several work methods and take user needs into account. How to understand the needs of students and teachers, and what are the most important factors.</p>
        <p class="txt">In 2023, the director of HEAJ Namur suggested that the students in the option should rethink the layout of the schoolyard, with a budget.</p>
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"This project took me out of my comfort zone, and as a group we considered the factors and constraints of the environment, interviewed students and drew up a list of needs. Personally, I concentrated on the green space and relaxation aspect, hence the artistic direction of my site, inspired by cloud-coloured empty space and tree-coloured graphic elements."</p>

        <h2 class="title title--high">Rethinking what already exists.</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">Conceive an experience based on a need and a space.</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">Using Design Thinking methods, create an experience for students, the DWT section, management and future students. Without forgetting that this experience must be useful in the school context.</p>
        <p class="txt">In 2024, RuX's objective is to design a device, an object, a playful and useful experience that responds to a problem in a school context.</p>
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"This group work was really interesting, we focused on Group Work, we researched existing psychological studies on success and failure factors, the different roles in a group and their interests, to create explanatory posters and we designed a wooden plinko that serves as an interactive game to choose a role, all set up in the classroom."</p>

        <h2 class="title title--high">Interactive experience</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">Use real or fictional data to create a web experience.</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">The Data Play experience is based on the use of data sets to design an interactive and graphical experience.</p>
        <p class="txt">Data exists on a wide range of subjects, from food and health to addictions and thousands more, so Guewen's group chose to create fictional data to create the card game Master Of The Classroom.</p>
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"We could choose an offbeat or provocative subject in the instructions, so we created a card game with the school's teachers, based on a system of strength points and bonus malus depending on an element. I really enjoyed devoting myself entirely to the graphic design of the game, the decor, the cards and the look and feel of the website."</p>

        <h2 class="title title--high">End of year work</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">A positive impact on society.</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">Identify users and a problem, formulate hypotheses and propose a solution.</p>
        <p class="txt">The goal of the End of year work was to identify a problem encountered by a population and develop a solution, presenting our approach via a website.</p>
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"It was a complicated job to set up, I went to meet people facing digital insecurity, members of associations helping these people. 
            I came up against a brick wall because there are very few solutions to help people affected by the digital divide, but it is still possible to have a positive impact on these people by directing them towards help and training."</p>
