        <h2 class="title title--high">A start to everything</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">The first steps in the professional world</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">In parallel with his studies, Guewen has had the opportunity to work for various companies in the events and catering sectors.</p>
        <p class="txt">You don't have to wait for your degree to put the skills you've learnt to use in the world of work, luckily you have to seize the opportunity, even if sometimes the project doesn't come to a successful conclusion.</p>

        <h2 class="title title--high">Tattoo Convention</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">Your first step into the world of events</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">Every year for the past 7 years, the Groove Ink Tattoo convention has been hosted in Mons, Belgium, in a 2,500 m2 space featuring international artists.</p>
        <p class="txt">Guewen was asked to design the poster, banners and t-shirt visuals: "<i>It was a really great opportunity, I love tattooing and dedicated conventions, so I had no hesitation in agreeing to work for them</i>".</p>
        <p class="txt">Placed in the city centre and distributed as flyers, the key to the success of such an event is awareness and communication. "<i>The design of the fox was done by a tattoo artist, and I took care of the layout in different formats. It's really rewarding to see your work in public environments, on A2 size posters and in flyers in shops</i>".</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p class="txt txt--itw">"I also had the chance to take care of the convention's merchandising visuals, which were very sober, but that's also what I was asked to do. I'd already done some textile prints and other goodies as a work experience student."</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h2 class="title title--high">Music Festival</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--med">Second events project</h3>
        <p class="txt txt--intro">Storm-X is a techno and electro festival. The first edition took place this year at the Lotto Mons Expo on 18 May and was attended by 5,000 people.</p>
        <p class="txt">The first edition of a music event is a crucial moment, its success and its repetition depend on the quality of the event and the publicity given to it. "<i>I was very lucky to be approached to do this project, it's a big responsibility and a huge workload, but I love techno so I was really excited to do it</i>".</p>
        <p class="txt">Communication on social networks is one of the best ways of promoting the event, targeting an audience and attracting the maximum number of people interested in this type of event. "<i>As well as the banners and flyers, they asked me if I knew how to edit videos, and the objective was to make a 30-second video every 2 weeks presenting the artists, the venue, the date and the 3 sales waves, and I really enjoyed it</i>".</p>
